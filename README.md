# Gesture-Based Software Control using Python
### Overview
This project allows users to control software using hand gestures. The system leverages computer vision techniques to recognize gestures in real-time, enabling interaction without the need for physical devices such as a keyboard or mouse. This project is built using Python and various machine learning and data science libraries, including OpenCV, NumPy, and TensorFlow.

### Features
1.  Real-Time Gesture Recognition: Detects hand gestures using a webcam and processes them in real-time.
2.  Customizable Gesture Control: Allows users to define custom gestures to trigger specific actions.

### Installation
### Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

*  Python
*  OpenCV
*  NumPy
*  MediaPipe (for hand-tracking and pose estimation)
*  PyAutoGUI (for software control)
